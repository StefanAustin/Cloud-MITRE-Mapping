* Open draw.io and import the Log Source- MITRE Mapping.drawio file to edit as per your need.
* Open Attack- Navigator and select new layer > Upload existing and import Cloud MITRE Mapping.json to start with. You can edit/remove as per your need. Once done, export the same as PNG/JSON/Excel what suits you best. If you want to get your inhouse Attack Navigator, follow this- https://youtu.be/LVcYOwLqW_Y
* Then start working on the Detection Usecases.
